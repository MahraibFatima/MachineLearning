# Foundational unsupervised learning concepts

Unsupervised machine learning is based on the following core concepts:

- Data
- Model
- Training
- Evaluating
- Inference

## Data

Data is the driving force of ML. Data comes in the form of words and numbers stored in tables, or as the values of pixels and waveforms captured in images and audio files.

`A dataset can also be characterized by the number of its features.`

## Model

In unsupervised learning, a model is a complex collection of algorithms that identify patterns and structures within input data without the need for labeled outputs. The model discovers these patterns through training.

## Training

In unsupervised learning, the model is trained using a dataset that contains only input features without corresponding output labels. The goal of the model is to uncover hidden structures and relationships within the data. Common unsupervised learning techniques include clustering, where the model groups similar data points together, and dimensionality reduction, where the model reduces the number of features while preserving essential information.

## Evaluating

Evaluating an unsupervised model is more challenging than evaluating a supervised model because there are no predefined labels to compare against. Evaluation often involves techniques such as measuring the compactness and separation of clusters in clustering tasks or assessing the reconstruction error in dimensionality reduction tasks. Domain knowledge and visualization methods are frequently used to interpret the quality of the model's output.

## Inference

Once we're satisfied with the results from evaluating the model, we can use the model to make predictions or provide insights on new, unlabeled data. For example, in a customer segmentation task, we might use a clustering model to group new customers into segments based on their purchasing behavior, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies.
