# Foundational reinforcement learning concepts

Reinforcement learning is based on the following core concepts:

- Data
- Model
- Training
- Evaluating
- Inference

## Data

Data in reinforcement learning comes in the form of sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Unlike supervised or unsupervised learning, the data is often generated dynamically through the interactions between the agent and the environment.

## Model

In reinforcement learning, a model represents the agent that interacts with the environment. The agent's goal is to learn a policy—a mapping from states to actions—that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. The model can be based on various algorithms, such as Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), or Policy Gradients.

## Training

Training in reinforcement learning involves the agent interacting with the environment, taking actions based on its current policy, and receiving feedback in the form of rewards. The agent uses this feedback to update its policy, improving its performance over time. Training often involves balancing exploration (trying new actions to discover their effects) and exploitation (choosing actions known to yield high rewards).

## Evaluating

Evaluating a reinforcement learning model involves assessing how well the agent performs in the environment according to a predefined metric, such as cumulative reward. This evaluation can be done by running the agent in the environment and measuring its performance over a series of episodes. Evaluation helps determine whether the agent has learned an effective policy.

## Inference

Inference in reinforcement learning involves using the trained policy to make decisions in the environment. Once the agent has been trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to interact with the environment, making decisions that are expected to maximize cumulative rewards. For example, in a robotics application, the trained agent might control a robot to navigate through obstacles and reach a destination efficiently.
