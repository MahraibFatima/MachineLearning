# Cost Function:
The cost function or the loss function is nothing but the error or difference between the predicted value $\hat{Y}$ and the true value $Y$.


In Linear Regression, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function is employed, which calculates the average of the squared errors between the predicted values $\hat{y}_i$ and the actual values ${y}^i$.The purpose is to determine the optimal values for the intercept $b$    and the coefficient of the input feature $w$  
providing the best-fit line for the given data points. The linear equation expressing this relationship is $f_{w,b}(x) = wx + b$.
